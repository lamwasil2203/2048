# 2048

An AI-driven version of the 2048 puzzle game where the agent uses expectimax search and alpha-beta pruning to simulate future moves and maximize score. The AI evaluates tile configurations, merges possibilities, and uses heuristic evaluation functions (e.g., smoothness, monotonicity, empty tiles) to make optimal decisions in real time.
